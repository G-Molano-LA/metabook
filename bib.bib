  abstract      = {We show that the Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem and the related problems of String Isomorphism (under group action) (SI) and Coset Intersection (CI) can be solved in quasipolynomial (\$\textbackslash exp((\textbackslash log n)\^\{O(1)\})\$) time. The best previous bound for GI was \$\textbackslash exp(O(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\textbackslash log n\}))\$, where \$n\$ is the number of vertices (Luks, 1983); for the other two problems, the bound was similar, \$\textbackslash exp(\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}))\$, where \$n\$ is the size of the permutation domain (Babai, 1983). The algorithm builds on Luks's SI framework and attacks the barrier configurations for Luks's algorithm by group theoretic "local certificates" and combinatorial canonical partitioning techniques. We show that in a well-defined sense, Johnson graphs are the only obstructions to effective canonical partitioning. Luks's barrier situation is characterized by a homomorphism \{\textbackslash phi\} that maps a given permutation group \$G\$ onto \$S\_k\$ or \$A\_k\$, the symmetric or alternating group of degree \$k\$, where \$k\$ is not too small. We say that an element \$x\$ in the permutation domain on which \$G\$ acts is affected by \{\textbackslash phi\} if the \{\textbackslash phi\}-image of the stabilizer of \$x\$ does not contain \$A\_k\$. The affected/unaffected dichotomy underlies the core "local certificates" routine and is the central divide-and-conquer tool of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {The global mapping of transcription boundaries is a key step in the elucidation of the full complement of transcriptional features of an organism. It facilitates the annotation of operons and untranslated regions as well as novel transcripts, including cis- and trans-encoded small RNAs (sRNAs). So called RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) based on deep sequencing of cDNAs has greatly facilitated transcript mapping with single nucleotide resolution. However, conventional RNA-seq approaches typically cannot distinguish between primary and processed transcripts. Here we describe the recently developed differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) approach, which facilitates the annotation of transcriptional start sites (TSS) based on deep sequencing of two differentially treated cDNA library pairs, with one library being enriched for primary transcripts. Using the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori as a model organism, we describe the application of dRNA-seq together with an automated TSS annotation approach for generation of a genome-wide TSS map in bacteria. Besides a description of transcriptome and regulatory features that can be identified by this approach, we discuss the impact of different library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms as well as manual and automated TSS annotation. Moreover, we have set up an easily accessible online browser for visualization of the H. pylori transcriptome data from this and our previous H. pylori dRNA-seq study.}

  abstract = { The oral microbiome is one of the most stable ecosystems in the body and yet the reasons for this are still unclear. As well as being stable, it is also highly diverse which can be ascribed to the variety of niches available in the mouth. Previous studies have focused on the microflora in disease—either caries or periodontitis—and only recently have they considered factors that maintain the normal microflora. This has led to the perception that the microflora proliferate in nutrient-rich periods during oral processing of foods and drinks and starves in between times. In this review, evidence is presented which shows that the normal flora are maintained on a diet of salivary factors including urea, lactate, and salivary protein degradation. These factors are actively secreted by salivary glands which suggests these factors are important in maintaining normal commensals in the mouth. In addition, the immobilization of SIgA in the mucosal pellicle indicates a mechanism to retain certain bacteria that does not rely on the bacterial-centric mechanisms such as adhesins. By examining the salivary metabolome, it is clear that protein degradation is a key nutrient and the availability of free amino acids increases resistance to environmental stresses. }

  abstract = {Genomes are an integral component of the biological information about an organism; thus, the more complete the genome, the more informative it is. Historically, bacterial and archaeal genomes were reconstructed from pure (monoclonal) cultures, and the first reported sequences were manually curated to completion. However, the bottleneck imposed by the requirement for isolates precluded genomic insights for the vast majority of microbial life. Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities, referred to initially as community genomics and subsequently as genome-resolved metagenomics, can circumvent this limitation by obtaining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs); but gaps, local assembly errors, chimeras, and contamination by fragments from other genomes limit the value of these genomes. Here, we discuss genome curation to improve and, in some cases, achieve complete (circularized, no gaps) MAGs (CMAGs). To date, few CMAGs have been generated, although notably some are from very complex systems such as soil and sediment. Through analysis of about 7000 published complete bacterial isolate genomes, we verify the value of cumulative GC skew in combination with other metrics to establish bacterial genome sequence accuracy. The analysis of cumulative GC skew identified potential misassemblies in some reference genomes of isolated bacteria and the repeat sequences that likely gave rise to them. We discuss methods that could be implemented in bioinformatic approaches for curation to ensure that metabolic and evolutionary analyses can be based on very high-quality genomes.},

  abstract = {The expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD) is a comprehensive microbiome database for sites along the human aerodigestive tract that revealed new insights into the nostril microbiome. The eHOMD provides well-curated 16S rRNA gene reference sequences linked to available genomes and enables assignment of species-level taxonomy to most next-generation sequences derived from diverse aerodigestive tract sites, including the nasal passages, sinuses, throat, esophagus, and mouth. Using minimum entropy decomposition coupled with the RDP Classifier and our eHOMD V1-V3 training set, we reanalyzed 16S rRNA V1-V3 sequences from the nostrils of 210 Human Microbiome Project participants at the species level, revealing four key insights. First, we discovered that Lawsonella clevelandensis, a recently named bacterium, and Neisseriaceae [G-1] HMT-174, a previously unrecognized bacterium, are common in adult nostrils. Second, just 19 species accounted for 90\% of the total sequences from all participants. Third, 1 of these 19 species belonged to a currently uncultivated genus. Fourth, for 94\% of the participants, 2 to 10 species constituted 90\% of their sequences, indicating that the nostril microbiome may be represented by limited consortia. These insights highlight the strengths of the nostril microbiome as a model system for studying interspecies interactions and microbiome function. Also, in this cohort, three common nasal species (Dolosigranulum pigrum and two Corynebacterium species) showed positive differential abundance when the pathobiont Staphylococcus aureus was absent, generating hypotheses regarding colonization resistance. By facilitating species-level taxonomic assignment to microbes from the human aerodigestive tract, the eHOMD is a vital resource enhancing clinical relevance of microbiome studies. IMPORTANCE The eHOMD (http://www.ehomd.org) is a valuable resource for researchers, from basic to clinical, who study the microbiomes and the individual microbes in body sites in the human aerodigestive tract, which includes the nasal passages, sinuses, throat, esophagus, and mouth, and the lower respiratory tract, in health and disease. The eHOMD is an actively curated, web-based, open-access resource. eHOMD provides the following: (i) species-level taxonomy based on grouping 16S rRNA gene sequences at 98.5\% identity, (ii) a systematic naming scheme for unnamed and/or uncultivated microbial taxa, (iii) reference genomes to facilitate metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and proteomic studies and (iv) convenient cross-links to other databases (e.g., PubMed and Entrez). By facilitating the assignment of species names to sequences, the eHOMD is a vital resource for enhancing the clinical relevance of 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome studies, as well as metagenomic studies.}

However, each of these MGE types is usually annotated and analysed individually, hampering a global understanding of phylogenetic and environmental patterns of MGE dispersal. We thus developed a computational framework that captures diverse MGE types, their cargos and MGE-mediated horizontal transfer events, using recombinases as ubiquitous MGE marker genes and pangenome information for MGE boundary estimation. Applied to ∼84k genomes with habitat annotation, we mapped 2.8 million MGE-specific recombinases to six operational MGE types, which together contain on average 13\% of all the genes in a genome. Transposable elements (TEs) dominated across all taxa (∼1.7 million occurrences), outnumbering phages and phage-like elements (\&lt;0.4 million). We recorded numerous MGE-mediated horizontal transfer events across diverse phyla and habitats involving all MGE types, disentangled and quantified the extent of hitchhiking of TEs (17\%) and integrons (63\%) with other MGE categories, and established TEs as dominant carriers of antibiotic resistance genes. We integrated all these findings into a resource (proMGE.embl.de), which should facilitate future studies on the large mobile part of genomes and its horizontal dispersal.}},

We revealed the death-inducing phenotype of the Hok toxin when it is expressed from the chromosome in the absence of the antitoxin and recovered previously described intragenic toxicity determinants of this system. We identified nucleotides that are essential for the transcription, translation or activity of Hok. We also discovered single-nucleotide substitutions leading to structural changes affecting either the translation or the stability of the hok mRNA.

  abstract = {RNA-sequencing has revolutionized the quantitative and qualitative analysis of transcriptomes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It provides a generic approach for gene expression profiling, annotation of transcript boundaries and operons, as well as identifying novel transcripts including small noncoding RNA molecules and antisense RNAs. We recently developed a differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) method which in addition to the above, yields information as to whether a given RNA is a primary or processed transcript. Originally applied to describe the primary transcriptome of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, dRNA-seq has since provided global maps of transcriptional start sites in diverse species, informed new biology in the CRISPR-Cas9 system, advanced to a tool for comparative transcriptomics, and inspired simultaneous RNA-seq of pathogen and host.}

  abstract = {Summary
              The mouth presents a multiplicity of local environments in communication with one another via saliva. The spatial organization of microbes within the mouth is shaped by opposing forces in dynamic equilibrium—salivary flow and adhesion, shedding and colonization—and by interactions among and between microbes and the host. Here we review recent evidence confirming that oral microbes are specialized for individual habitats within the mouth and that microbial habitats and niches are defined by micron-scale gradients in combination with short- and long-range interactions. Micron-scale structure illuminates the roles of individual taxa and provides insight into their community ecology and potential pathogenicity.}

  abstract = {Summary
              A fundamental question in microbial ecology is how microbes are spatially organized with respect to each other and their host. A test bed for examining this question is the tongue dorsum, which harbors a complex and important microbial community. Here, we use multiplexed fluorescence spectral imaging to investigate the organization of the tongue microbiome at micron to hundred-micron scales. We design oligonucleotide probes for taxa both abundant and prevalent, as determined by sequence analysis. Imaging reveals a highly structured spatial organization of microbial consortia, ranging in linear dimension from tens to hundreds of microns. The consortia appear to develop from a core of epithelial cells, with taxa clustering in domains suggestive of clonal expansion. Quantitative proximity analysis provides the basis for a model of tongue dorsum microbiome organization and dynamics. Our work illustrates how high-resolution analysis of micron-scale organization provides insights into physiological functions and microbiome-host interactions.}
