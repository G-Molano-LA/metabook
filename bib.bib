  abstract  = {I was invited to write a brief introductory overview of the human genome and human genomics. Considering that this subject matter occupies whole books, the most I could aspire was to produce a very incomplete ``CliffsNote view'' of the human genome. Moreover, the chapters that follow will provide a lot of useful genomic information and I wanted to keep out of their turf. I have rather opted to focus in on only three interrelated genomic topics: (A) a bird's-eye view of selected aspects of the structure and evolution of the human genome; (B) consequences of the abundance of retroposons, retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses, which make up 41{\%} of the human genome. This subject also has some topical interest, considering that humankind is right now being held ransom by an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes the serious disease COVID-19; (C) genomic sequencing as a clinical tool for the accurate prediction of disease risk in Precision Medicine.},

This chapter starts with the introduction of bacterial genomes, genome sequencing methods, and subsequent genetic annotation. Pan-genome and phylogeny analyses allow us to analyze many genomes simultaneously. Many tools have been developed to support the analysis of bacterial protein features, such as subcellular location and adhesin probability. Proteome-wide analysis of these features allows us to further predict vaccine antigen candidates and virulence factors, which is also the foundation of reverse vaccinology. Bacterial whole genome sequences have also been used in various applications such as genomic diagnosis, epidemiology, host-microbiome interaction and pathogenesis studies. Data FAIRness and ontology are required to support heterogeneous data standardization and integration.}

However, each of these MGE types is usually annotated and analysed individually, hampering a global understanding of phylogenetic and environmental patterns of MGE dispersal. We thus developed a computational framework that captures diverse MGE types, their cargos and MGE-mediated horizontal transfer events, using recombinases as ubiquitous MGE marker genes and pangenome information for MGE boundary estimation. Applied to ∼84k genomes with habitat annotation, we mapped 2.8 million MGE-specific recombinases to six operational MGE types, which together contain on average 13\% of all the genes in a genome. Transposable elements (TEs) dominated across all taxa (∼1.7 million occurrences), outnumbering phages and phage-like elements (\&lt;0.4 million). We recorded numerous MGE-mediated horizontal transfer events across diverse phyla and habitats involving all MGE types, disentangled and quantified the extent of hitchhiking of TEs (17\%) and integrons (63\%) with other MGE categories, and established TEs as dominant carriers of antibiotic resistance genes. We integrated all these findings into a resource (proMGE.embl.de), which should facilitate future studies on the large mobile part of genomes and its horizontal dispersal.}},

This method combines a life and death selection with deep sequencing. Here, we adapted and improved our method to investigate T1TAs in the model organism Escherichia coli. As a proof of concept, we revisited the regulation of the plasmidic hok/Sok T1TA system. We revealed the death-inducing phenotype of the Hok toxin when it is expressed from the chromosome in the absence of the antitoxin and recovered previously described intragenic toxicity determinants of this system. We identified nucleotides that are essential for the transcription, translation or activity of Hok. We also discovered single-nucleotide substitutions leading to structural changes affecting either the translation or the stability of the hok mRNA.

Originally applied to describe the primary transcriptome of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, dRNA-seq has since provided global maps of transcriptional start sites in diverse species, informed new biology in the CRISPR-Cas9 system, advanced to a tool for comparative transcriptomics, and inspired simultaneous RNA-seq of pathogen and host.}

It facilitates the annotation of operons and untranslated regions as well as novel transcripts, including cis- and trans-encoded small RNAs (sRNAs). So called RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) based on deep sequencing of cDNAs has greatly facilitated transcript mapping with single nucleotide resolution. However, conventional RNA-seq approaches typically cannot distinguish between primary and processed transcripts. Here we describe the recently developed differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) approach, which facilitates the annotation of transcriptional start sites (TSS) based on deep sequencing of two differentially treated cDNA library pairs, with one library being enriched for primary transcripts. Using the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori as a model organism, we describe the application of dRNA-seq together with an automated TSS annotation approach for generation of a genome-wide TSS map in bacteria. Besides a description of transcriptome and regulatory features that can be identified by this approach, we discuss the impact of different library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms as well as manual and automated TSS annotation. Moreover, we have set up an easily accessible online browser for visualization of the H. pylori transcriptome data from this and our previous H. pylori dRNA-seq study.}

  abstract = {The field of microbiome research has evolved rapidly over the past few decades and has become a topic of great scientific and public interest. As a result of this rapid growth in interest covering different fields, we are lacking a clear commonly agreed definition of the term ``microbiome.'' Moreover, a consensus on best practices in microbiome research is missing. Recently, a panel of international experts discussed the current gaps in the frame of the European-funded MicrobiomeSupport project. The meeting brought together about 40 leaders from diverse microbiome areas, while more than a hundred experts from all over the world took part in an online survey accompanying the workshop. This article excerpts the outcomes of the workshop and the corresponding online survey embedded in a short historical introduction and future outlook. We propose a definition of microbiome based on the compact, clear, and comprehensive description of the term provided by Whipps et al. in 1988, amended with a set of novel recommendations considering the latest technological developments and research findings. We clearly separate the terms microbiome and microbiota and provide a comprehensive discussion considering the composition of microbiota, the heterogeneity and dynamics of microbiomes in time and space, the stability and resilience of microbial networks, the definition of core microbiomes, and functionally relevant keystone species as well as co-evolutionary principles of microbe-host and inter-species interactions within the microbiome. These broad definitions together with the suggested unifying concepts will help to improve standardization of microbiome studies in the future, and could be the starting point for an integrated assessment of data resulting in a more rapid transfer of knowledge from basic science into practice. Furthermore, microbiome standards are important for solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes in the field of planetary health, for which the understanding of microbiomes might play a key role.},

These studies also indicate that steroid regulation of the gut microbiome may play a role in pathological situations of hormonal excess, such as PCOS. Indeed, studies demonstrated that PCOS is associated with decreased alpha diversity and changes in specific Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, previously associated with metabolic dysregulation. These studies suggest that androgens may regulate the gut microbiome in females and that hyperandrogenism may be linked with a gut ‘dysbiosis’ in PCOS. Future mechanistic studies will be required to elucidate how sex steroids regulate the composition and function of the gut microbial community and what the consequences of this regulation are for the host.}

Historically, bacterial and archaeal genomes were reconstructed from pure (monoclonal) cultures, and the first reported sequences were manually curated to completion. However, the bottleneck imposed by the requirement for isolates precluded genomic insights for the vast majority of microbial life. Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities, referred to initially as community genomics and subsequently as genome-resolved metagenomics, can circumvent this limitation by obtaining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs); but gaps, local assembly errors, chimeras, and contamination by fragments from other genomes limit the value of these genomes. Here, we discuss genome curation to improve and, in some cases, achieve complete (circularized, no gaps) MAGs (CMAGs). To date, few CMAGs have been generated, although notably some are from very complex systems such as soil and sediment. Through analysis of about 7000 published complete bacterial isolate genomes, we verify the value of cumulative GC skew in combination with other metrics to establish bacterial genome sequence accuracy. The analysis of cumulative GC skew identified potential misassemblies in some reference genomes of isolated bacteria and the repeat sequences that likely gave rise to them. We discuss methods that could be implemented in bioinformatic approaches for curation to ensure that metabolic and evolutionary analyses can be based on very high-quality genomes.},

  abstract = { Abstract Recent advances in single-cell genomics provide an alternative to largely gene-centric metagenomics studies, enabling whole-genome sequencing of uncultivated bacteria. However, single-cell assembly projects are challenging due to (i) the highly nonuniform read coverage and (ii) a greatly elevated number of chimeric reads and read pairs. While recently developed single-cell assemblers have addressed the former challenge, methods for assembling highly chimeric reads remain poorly explored. We present algorithms for identifying chimeric edges and resolving complex bulges in de Bruijn graphs, which significantly improve single-cell assemblies. We further describe applications of the single-cell assembler SPAdes to a new approach for capturing and sequencing “microbial dark matter” that forms small pools of randomly selected single cells (called a mini-metagenome) and further sequences all genomes from the mini-metagenome at once. On single-cell bacterial datasets, SPAdes improves on the recently developed E+V-SC and IDBA-UD assemblers specifically designed for single-cell sequencing. For standard (cultivated monostrain) datasets, SPAdes also improves on A5, ABySS, CLC, EULER-SR, Ray, SOAPdenovo, and Velvet. Thus, recently developed single-cell assemblers not only enable single-cell sequencing, but also improve on conventional assemblers on their own turf. SPAdes is available for free online download under a GPLv2 license. }

  abstract = {The lion's share of bacteria in various environments cannot be cloned in the laboratory and thus cannot be sequenced using existing technologies. A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V-SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades). It is distributed as open source software. }

The spatial organization of microbes within the mouth is shaped by opposing forces in dynamic equilibrium—salivary flow and adhesion, shedding and colonization—and by interactions among and between microbes and the host. Here we review recent evidence confirming that oral microbes are specialized for individual habitats within the mouth and that microbial habitats and niches are defined by micron-scale gradients in combination with short- and long-range interactions. Micron-scale structure illuminates the roles of individual taxa and provides insight into their community ecology and potential pathogenicity.}

  abstract = {Summary
              A fundamental question in microbial ecology is how microbes are spatially organized with respect to each other and their host. A test bed for examining this question is the tongue dorsum, which harbors a complex and important microbial community. Here, we use multiplexed fluorescence spectral imaging to investigate the organization of the tongue microbiome at micron to hundred-micron scales. We design oligonucleotide probes for taxa both abundant and prevalent, as determined by sequence analysis. Imaging reveals a highly structured spatial organization of microbial consortia, ranging in linear dimension from tens to hundreds of microns. The consortia appear to develop from a core of epithelial cells, with taxa clustering in domains suggestive of clonal expansion. Quantitative proximity analysis provides the basis for a model of tongue dorsum microbiome organization and dynamics. Our work illustrates how high-resolution analysis of micron-scale organization provides insights into physiological functions and microbiome-host interactions.}

The spatial ecology of the microbial communities that inhabit the human body—in particular, those of the nose, mouth, and throat—deserves greater attention. Important questions include what defines the size of a population (i.e., “patch”) in a given body site, what defines the boundaries of distinct patches within a single body site, and where and over what spatial scales within a body site are gradients detected. This Review looks at the landscape ecology of the upper respiratory tract and mouth and seeks greater clarity about the physiological factors—whether immunological, chemical, or physical—that govern microbial community composition and function and the ecological traits that underlie health and disease.}

Emerging evidence from interventional studies indicates that local treatment of periodontitis ameliorates surrogate markers of comorbid conditions. The potential causal link between periodontitis and its comorbidities is further strengthened by recent experimental animal studies establishing biologically plausible and clinically consistent mechanisms whereby periodontitis could initiate or aggravate a comorbid condition. This multi-faceted `mechanistic causality' aspect of the link between periodontitis and comorbidities is the focus of this Review. Understanding how certain extra-oral pathologies are affected by disseminated periodontal pathogens and periodontitis-associated systemic inflammation, including adaptation of bone marrow haematopoietic progenitors, may provide new therapeutic options to reduce the risk of periodontitis-associated comorbidities.},

  abstract = {The expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD) is a comprehensive microbiome database for sites along the human aerodigestive tract that revealed new insights into the nostril microbiome. The eHOMD provides well-curated 16S rRNA gene reference sequences linked to available genomes and enables assignment of species-level taxonomy to most next-generation sequences derived from diverse aerodigestive tract sites, including the nasal passages, sinuses, throat, esophagus, and mouth. Using minimum entropy decomposition coupled with the RDP Classifier and our eHOMD V1-V3 training set, we reanalyzed 16S rRNA V1-V3 sequences from the nostrils of 210 Human Microbiome Project participants at the species level, revealing four key insights. First, we discovered that Lawsonella clevelandensis, a recently named bacterium, and Neisseriaceae [G-1] HMT-174, a previously unrecognized bacterium, are common in adult nostrils. Second, just 19 species accounted for 90\% of the total sequences from all participants. Third, 1 of these 19 species belonged to a currently uncultivated genus. Fourth, for 94\% of the participants, 2 to 10 species constituted 90\% of their sequences, indicating that the nostril microbiome may be represented by limited consortia. These insights highlight the strengths of the nostril microbiome as a model system for studying interspecies interactions and microbiome function. Also, in this cohort, three common nasal species (Dolosigranulum pigrum and two Corynebacterium species) showed positive differential abundance when the pathobiont Staphylococcus aureus was absent, generating hypotheses regarding colonization resistance. By facilitating species-level taxonomic assignment to microbes from the human aerodigestive tract, the eHOMD is a vital resource enhancing clinical relevance of microbiome studies. IMPORTANCE The eHOMD (http://www.ehomd.org) is a valuable resource for researchers, from basic to clinical, who study the microbiomes and the individual microbes in body sites in the human aerodigestive tract, which includes the nasal passages, sinuses, throat, esophagus, and mouth, and the lower respiratory tract, in health and disease. The eHOMD is an actively curated, web-based, open-access resource. eHOMD provides the following: (i) species-level taxonomy based on grouping 16S rRNA gene sequences at 98.5\% identity, (ii) a systematic naming scheme for unnamed and/or uncultivated microbial taxa, (iii) reference genomes to facilitate metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and proteomic studies and (iv) convenient cross-links to other databases (e.g., PubMed and Entrez). By facilitating the assignment of species names to sequences, the eHOMD is a vital resource for enhancing the clinical relevance of 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome studies, as well as metagenomic studies.}

  abstract = {The oral cavity of each person is home to hundreds of bacterial species. While taxa for oral diseases have been studied using culture-based characterization as well as amplicon sequencing, metagenomic and genomic information remains scarce compared to the fecal microbiome. Here, using metagenomic shotgun data for 3346 oral metagenomic samples together with 808 published samples, we obtain 56,213 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), and more than 64\% of the 3589 species-level genome bins (SGBs) contain no publicly available genomes. The resulting genome collection is representative of samples around the world and contains many genomes from candidate phyla radiation (CPR) that lack monoculture. Also, it enables the discovery of new taxa such as a genus Candidatus Bgiplasma within the family Acholeplasmataceae. Large-scale metagenomic data from massive samples also allow the assembly of strains from important oral taxa such as Porphyromonas and Neisseria. The oral microbes encode genes that could potentially metabolize drugs. Apart from these findings, a strongly male-enriched Campylobacter species was identified. Oral samples would be more user-friendly collected than fecal samples and have the potential for disease diagnosis. Thus, these data lay down a genomic framework for future inquiries of the human oral microbiome.}

  abstract = { The oral microbiome is one of the most stable ecosystems in the body and yet the reasons for this are still unclear. As well as being stable, it is also highly diverse which can be ascribed to the variety of niches available in the mouth. Previous studies have focused on the microflora in disease—either caries or periodontitis—and only recently have they considered factors that maintain the normal microflora. This has led to the perception that the microflora proliferate in nutrient-rich periods during oral processing of foods and drinks and starves in between times. In this review, evidence is presented which shows that the normal flora are maintained on a diet of salivary factors including urea, lactate, and salivary protein degradation. These factors are actively secreted by salivary glands which suggests these factors are important in maintaining normal commensals in the mouth. In addition, the immobilization of SIgA in the mucosal pellicle indicates a mechanism to retain certain bacteria that does not rely on the bacterial-centric mechanisms such as adhesins. By examining the salivary metabolome, it is clear that protein degradation is a key nutrient and the availability of free amino acids increases resistance to environmental stresses. }
