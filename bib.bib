  abstract = {We show that the Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem and the related problems of String Isomorphism (under group action) (SI) and Coset Intersection (CI) can be solved in quasipolynomial (\$\textbackslash exp((\textbackslash log n)\^\{O(1)\})\$) time. The best previous bound for GI was \$\textbackslash exp(O(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\textbackslash log n\}))\$, where \$n\$ is the number of vertices (Luks, 1983); for the other two problems, the bound was similar, \$\textbackslash exp(\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}))\$, where \$n\$ is the size of the permutation domain (Babai, 1983). The algorithm builds on Luks's SI framework and attacks the barrier configurations for Luks's algorithm by group theoretic "local certificates" and combinatorial canonical partitioning techniques. We show that in a well-defined sense, Johnson graphs are the only obstructions to effective canonical partitioning. Luks's barrier situation is characterized by a homomorphism \{\textbackslash phi\} that maps a given permutation group \$G\$ onto \$S\_k\$ or \$A\_k\$, the symmetric or alternating group of degree \$k\$, where \$k\$ is not too small. We say that an element \$x\$ in the permutation domain on which \$G\$ acts is affected by \{\textbackslash phi\} if the \{\textbackslash phi\}-image of the stabilizer of \$x\$ does not contain \$A\_k\$. The affected/unaffected dichotomy underlies the core "local certificates" routine and is the central divide-and-conquer tool of the algorithm.},

Considering that this subject matter occupies whole books, the most I could aspire was to produce a very incomplete ``CliffsNote view'' of the human genome. Moreover, the chapters that follow will provide a lot of useful genomic information and I wanted to keep out of their turf. I have rather opted to focus in on only three interrelated genomic topics: (A) a bird's-eye view of selected aspects of the structure and evolution of the human genome; (B) consequences of the abundance of retroposons, retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses, which make up 41{\%} of the human genome. This subject also has some topical interest, considering that humankind is right now being held ransom by an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes the serious disease COVID-19; (C) genomic sequencing as a clinical tool for the accurate prediction of disease risk in Precision Medicine.",

This chapter starts with the introduction of bacterial genomes, genome sequencing methods, and subsequent genetic annotation. Pan-genome and phylogeny analyses allow us to analyze many genomes simultaneously. Many tools have been developed to support the analysis of bacterial protein features, such as subcellular location and adhesin probability. Proteome-wide analysis of these features allows us to further predict vaccine antigen candidates and virulence factors, which is also the foundation of reverse vaccinology. Bacterial whole genome sequences have also been used in various applications such as genomic diagnosis, epidemiology, host–microbiome interaction and pathogenesis studies. Data FAIRness and ontology are required to support heterogeneous data standardization and integration.}

However, each of these MGE types is usually annotated and analysed individually, hampering a global understanding of phylogenetic and environmental patterns of MGE dispersal. We thus developed a computational framework that captures diverse MGE types, their cargos and MGE-mediated horizontal transfer events, using recombinases as ubiquitous MGE marker genes and pangenome information for MGE boundary estimation. Applied to ∼84k genomes with habitat annotation, we mapped 2.8 million MGE-specific recombinases to six operational MGE types, which together contain on average 13\% of all the genes in a genome. Transposable elements (TEs) dominated across all taxa (∼1.7 million occurrences), outnumbering phages and phage-like elements (\&lt;0.4 million). We recorded numerous MGE-mediated horizontal transfer events across diverse phyla and habitats involving all MGE types, disentangled and quantified the extent of hitchhiking of TEs (17\%) and integrons (63\%) with other MGE categories, and established TEs as dominant carriers of antibiotic resistance genes. We integrated all these findings into a resource (proMGE.embl.de), which should facilitate future studies on the large mobile part of genomes and its horizontal dispersal.}",

This method combines a life and death selection with deep sequencing. Here, we adapted and improved our method to investigate T1TAs in the model organism Escherichia coli. As a proof of concept, we revisited the regulation of the plasmidic hok/Sok T1TA system. We revealed the death-inducing phenotype of the Hok toxin when it is expressed from the chromosome in the absence of the antitoxin and recovered previously described intragenic toxicity determinants of this system. We identified nucleotides that are essential for the transcription, translation or activity of Hok. We also discovered single-nucleotide substitutions leading to structural changes affecting either the translation or the stability of the hok mRNA. Overall, we provide the community with an easy-to-use approach to widely characterize TA systems from diverse types and bacteria.}",

  abstract = {The global mapping of transcription boundaries is a key step in the elucidation of the full complement of transcriptional features of an organism. It facilitates the annotation of operons and untranslated regions as well as novel transcripts, including cis- and trans-encoded small RNAs (sRNAs). So called RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) based on deep sequencing of cDNAs has greatly facilitated transcript mapping with single nucleotide resolution. However, conventional RNA-seq approaches typically cannot distinguish between primary and processed transcripts. Here we describe the recently developed differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) approach, which facilitates the annotation of transcriptional start sites (TSS) based on deep sequencing of two differentially treated cDNA library pairs, with one library being enriched for primary transcripts. Using the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori as a model organism, we describe the application of dRNA-seq together with an automated TSS annotation approach for generation of a genome-wide TSS map in bacteria. Besides a description of transcriptome and regulatory features that can be identified by this approach, we discuss the impact of different library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms as well as manual and automated TSS annotation. Moreover, we have set up an easily accessible online browser for visualization of the H. pylori transcriptome data from this and our previous H. pylori dRNA-seq study.}

abstract ={Genomes are an integral component of the biological information about an organism; thus, the more complete the genome, the more informative it is. Historically, bacterial and archaeal genomes were reconstructed from pure (monoclonal) cultures, and the first reported sequences were manually curated to completion. However, the bottleneck imposed by the requirement for isolates precluded genomic insights for the vast majority of microbial life. Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities, referred to initially as community genomics and subsequently as genome-resolved metagenomics, can circumvent this limitation by obtaining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs); but gaps, local assembly errors, chimeras, and contamination by fragments from other genomes limit the value of these genomes. Here, we discuss genome curation to improve and, in some cases, achieve complete (circularized, no gaps) MAGs (CMAGs). To date, few CMAGs have been generated, although notably some are from very complex systems such as soil and sediment. Through analysis of about 7000 published complete bacterial isolate genomes, we verify the value of cumulative GC skew in combination with other metrics to establish bacterial genome sequence accuracy. The analysis of cumulative GC skew identified potential misassemblies in some reference genomes of isolated bacteria and the repeat sequences that likely gave rise to them. We discuss methods that could be implemented in bioinformatic approaches for curation to ensure that metabolic and evolutionary analyses can be based on very high-quality genomes.},
